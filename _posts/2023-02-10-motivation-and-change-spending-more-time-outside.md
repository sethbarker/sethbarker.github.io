&emsp; I consider myself ‘outdoorsy’; someone who has enjoyed the outdoors throughout my life.  When I reflect my happiest times, memories of youth soccer games, overnight hiking trips, and canoe trips come to mind.  My favorite travel has been to destinations that center around multi-day outdoor adventures. Writing this though, I’m reminded of the reality that I have not prioritized getting outside enough.  Just as I can fondly recall a hike, I can also remember countless times I sat on the couch scrolling on my phone.

**_Getting Motivated..._** \
&emsp; I remind myself of the practical benefits that simply getting outside can bring to someone.  Countless studies and [articles](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/spend-time-outdoors-itll-improve-your-health-say-experts/) can be found to affirm the premise that outdoor activity positively impacts mental and physical wellness.  And though I am no scientific researcher, I refer back to the ‘happy memories’ I mentioned earlier as sufficient (personal) evidence.  \
&emsp; I also have to be honest with myself about the types of experiences I want to have, and how those experiences shape how I think about myself.  Over the past several months, when faced with small choices in my daily life, I’ve often asked myself: “does it bring you joy?”  I’ve borrowed this question from the Danish concept of hygge, but found it helps guide me towards the activities I want to do.  \
&emsp; I am confident that being outside will reduce my anxiety, improve my physical health, and help me be the person I envision myself being - and that keeps me motivated.

**_Creating Lasting Change..._** \
&emsp; Setting up a framework for success is important.  A great first step is leveraging the personality traits each of us has to our own advantage.  For example, I can be intensely curious about the things around me.  I leveraged that curiosity to start riding my bike more frequently.  I saw the cycling community - the different riding styles, the independent bike shops, the group rides - and found it an interesting subculture worth investigating. I had an old bike collecting dust in my basement, why not pedal around the block? \
&emsp; The next step is creating achievable goals.  Personally, I recognize that I tend to look too far down the road, skipping over the smaller steps required to reach the big goals.  And, frankly, this ends up discouraging me.  By breaking down major goals into smaller milestones, I’ve been able to unlock bigger and bigger activities.  No one just hops on a bike and rides 100 miles the first day.  It starts with a trip around the neighborhood, then a group ride in the city, until you are able to pedal longer and explore farther. \
&emsp; Finally, I recommend finding others who share your interests or curiosities.  You can certainly enjoy outdoor activities in solitude; however, others help hold us accountable when we are trying to change our habits.  To this effect, my wife has been an incredible motivator for me to get off of the couch and explore outside.  With biking, she also bought a bike and we enjoy riding the surrounding trails together.  I’m not sure that biking would be as prevalent an activity in my life today if it wasn’t for her participation as well. \

Think about what motivates you and what frameworks or tools could help you find success.  Set practical goals.  Start exploring - you might just find joy, too.
